This repository contains the data and code necessary for my Strictly project.

song: the song that the couple danced to
series: what series this dance was in
week: which week the dance was in
running_order: the order in which the couple danced in the live show
score: Multiple columns of scores from each judge. If its a score of 0 then the judge was absent during that show.
